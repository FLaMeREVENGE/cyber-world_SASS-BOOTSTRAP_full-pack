## Description
My first independent project of a website that also has its subpages :heart:
###
How I did it:
1. I designed the look of the website with the help of Adobe Xd
2. I downloaded the images and basic HTML/CSS code thanks to the Adobe Xd plugin
3. I started work by creating subpage files for my homepage
4. Instead of writing CSS code, I used the SASS preprocessor
5. I tried to use the Bootstrap framework as often as possible
###
The whole thing looks very beautiful. SASS has greatly facilitated my work on responsiveness and arrangement of text and images. And thanks to Bootstrap, I easily managed the grid in the HTML code :neckbeard:
###
Check out what happens when you click on the links on each page :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
